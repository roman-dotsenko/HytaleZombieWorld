Zombie World - Hytale Mod Design Document
1. Vision Statement
A high-intensity, wave-based survival mod for Hytale where players fight escalating undead threats, manage a complex economy, and evolve their characters through branching class paths.
2. Shop & Stat Progression
The shop is the heart of the "Break Phase." Instead of just buying items, players invest in Stat Attributes and Gear Paths.
2.1 Melee Attribute Upgrades
Players can invest in individual melee stats before specializing into a class.
* Attack Power (AP): Raw damage per hit.
* Attack Speed: Reduces the cooldown between swings/animations.
* Knockback Magnitude: How far enemies are pushed back (useful for crowd control).
* Cleave/AoE: Percentage of damage dealt to enemies adjacent to the primary target.
* Lifesteal: Small percentage of HP recovered on successful hits.
2.2 Ranged Attribute Upgrades
To address the "investment" issue, Ranged is treated as a high-reward high-skill floor path.
* Projectile Velocity: Speed of arrows/bullets.
* Reload/Draw Speed: How quickly the next shot can be fired.
* Critical Chance: Percentage chance to deal double damage.
* Piercing: Number of enemies a single projectile can pass through.
* Ammo Capacity/Efficiency: Reduces the need to buy ammo or increases magazine size.
3. Class Specialization (The Branching Path)
Upgrades are linear until a "Pivot Point" (usually after 5 levels in a base stat). At this point, the player chooses a specialized Class.
Melee Path Branches

	Unlock Requirement
	Unique Perk

	4. The Ranged "Investment" Problem
1. Starter Kit: Provide a "Rusty Slingshot" or "Weak Bow" for free at Wave 1.
2. Distance Bonus: Ranged kills grant a 1.2x Coin multiplier if the enemy is killed from $>15$ blocks away.
3. Utility: Ranged weapons can "stagger" bosses from a distance.
5. Economy & Wave Control Mechanics
5.1 The Break Phase
* Smart Break Timer: Default 60 seconds.
* Player Forced Start: Players can interact with a "Ready" object or command to end the break immediately.
* Skip Bonus: Every second remaining on the timer when forced grants a small coin bonus ($+1$ per second per player).
5.2 Wave Progression (Trigger Logic)
The flow of combat is governed by Time-Based Ticks.
* Wave Ticks: A wave is not a single event but a sequence of timed spawns.
* The "Force Tick" Mechanic: If all enemies from a current tick are killed before the next tick timer expires, the next tick is automatically triggered early to keep the pace high.
6. Wave Structure (Predefined & Cyclic)
* Wave 1-10: Tutorial/Onboarding. Introduces basic Zombies, Crawlers, and Sprinters.
* Wave 11-20: Introduction of armored variants and the first Mini-Boss.
* Wave 21+: The Infinite Cycle.
   * Health scaling: $HP_{new} = HP_{base} \times (1.15^{Wave-20})$.
   * Spawn Rate scaling: Increases the "Enemies per Tick" by 1 every 5 waves.
